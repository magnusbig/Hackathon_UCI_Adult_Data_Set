# Hackathon_UCI_Adult_Data_Set
Magnus Bigelow &amp; John Wertz Hackathon Project, Predicting whether or not individuals make more than $50k using the UCI Adult Data Set and a constraint of using 20 or fewer features. Used 1 day (9-5) to complete project.

# Problem StatementÂ¶

Predict if a person's income is in excess of $50,000 given certain profile information, and more specifically to generate predicted probabilities of income being above $50,000 for each row in the test set, given an artificial constrain and an 8 hour period to complete the model and predictions.

**Constraint**
- Using a max of 20 features

## Data Sources 

The data used for this project was compiled using the PushShift API: 
    [PushShift](https://pushshift.io/api-parameters/)

10,000 most recent post were collected from r/woodworking, r/mtb, and r/bicylcing and the title and selftext (i.e. original post) columns were concatenated into a single 'text' column that was used for our analysis.

## Repo Structure

code
- Folder jupyter notebooks for data collection & EDA, modelling and testing the model on our second set of subreddit's

data
- Folder with csv's from web scrapping

visuals
- Folder with pictures for presentation and choice visuals from analysis
